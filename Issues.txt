1. Fix pagination in Client/Home.jsx : 131 (MEDIUM)
    {
        if page goes from 1 to 2 
        and the category changes
        for example we have 8 jobs for delhi 
        and 3 jobs for chandigarh
        , we shift to page 2 and select chandigarh category
        then it shows no jobs available.
    }

2. fix selected category filteration in Client/Home.jsx (MAJOR)
    {
        based on salary works but rest needs to be worked on;
    }
